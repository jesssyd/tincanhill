## About

This project was created in partnership with the Tin Can Hill Conservation Committee (TCHCC).

The Tin Can Hill Convservation Comittee is a team of people based out of the Northwest Territories who love Tin Can Hill for all it has to offer. We are dedicated to preserving Tin Can Hill as undeveloped greenspace for people to enjoy for generations to come.

Our mission is to secure permanent protection of Tin Can Hill. We believe that by preserving this land as recreational green space, we can create a legacy for future generations of Yellowknifers and visitors.

This project uses Next and Daisy UI (Tailwind CSS).
